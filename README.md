# poke-clone-demo
Refreshed my knowledge about Java & Clean Code by writing this demo game.

It's a pocket monsters clone, where the player can collect animals and fight against other animals (turn-based).

For the sake of simplicity, no database was used. A database would improve saving information & enable saving game files, though.

TODO: JUnit test cases & more refactoring would be important for future development, because of better code quality.
