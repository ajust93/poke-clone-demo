# poke-clone-demo
Refreshed my knowledge about Java & Clean Code by writing this demo game.
It's a pocket monsters clone, where the player can collect animals and fight against other animals (turn-based).
TODO: JUnit test cases & more refactoring would be important for future development, because of better code quality.
